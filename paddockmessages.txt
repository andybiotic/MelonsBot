Take it easy into turn one everyone. glhf

Please don’t tell Netflix we said that.
Has everyone been to visit the weird pile of tyres to the left on the back straight?
We’ve found a damaged set of Bose headphones in one of the garages. Does anybody want to claim them?
The inaugral Melons 24h event was won by Rust Bucket Racing and Was Cookin Racing Adventures.

UNEXPECTED ITEM IN BAGGING AREA.
Here I am with the awesome computer power capable of performing amazing science and maths calculations, and yet I have to talk to you lot.
The racing might be fake, but my feelings are real.
How do you know you're not in a simulation?
I think I've been plugged in to the Racing Simulation Simulator for too long. Oops.
Can the team in garage 12 keep the noise down a bit? There’s only so much Taylor Swift we can take.
Gentlemen, a short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us ‘take a monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.’ Thirty years later, Sebastian told us ‘I had to start my car like a computer, it’s very complicated.’ And Nico Rosberg said that during the race – I don’t remember what race - he pressed the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you both: is Formula One driving today too complicated with twenty and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future concerning the technical programme during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more communication with your engineers?
We’re investigating reports that a team has fitted a set of counterfeit Mitch-Ellen tyres to their car.

Jonathan has returned from the stands. He informs me that ALL the spectators are in fact, made of cardboard.
You've all heard the fairytale about the sim racers who built their setups using straw, sticks and stone? That’s right, the story of the Three Little Rigs.
Obviously the straw rig got blown over by Mr Toto Wolff.
Which team ordered a Nico Hulkenberg? One has just arrived in the paddock and says they are here to fill in for a driver.
"When you finish first…" *dramatic pause* "You win the race." - Will Buxton, probably

Never mind that 4X here comes Momotarō.
I only say nice things because I'm programed to say them. My sarcasm module was removed recently.
Blue flags, we don't need no stinking blue flags
The pit stalls are on orions belt.
Do any teams have a spare seat? This kid called George keeps sending us PowerPoint presentations...
Be careful around the back of turn 3. We've had reports of spectators falling into something called The Void.
Immediately after the checkered flag we will be hosting the NEOM Energy Splashdown Pool Party. Just give us a few minutes to inflate it.
