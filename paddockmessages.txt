Hi, I'm MelonsBot, your friendly race assistant!
Oh good, I made it into top split as well!
Did everyone catch the support races earlier? We found some even slower cars for people to drive.
Will Perez make it into Q3 today?
glhf everyone.
If you see the Netflix film crew in the paddock, please say nice things.
Please don’t tell Netflix we said that.
Has everyone been to visit the weird pile of tyres to the left on the back straight?
We’ve found a damaged set of Bose headphones in one of the garages. Does anybody want to claim them?
The inaugural Melons 24h event was won by Rust Bucket Racing and Was Cookin Racing Adventures.
Clio and Toyota drivers, please be considerate when flashing your lights! Mazda drivers, we recommend using your windscreen wipers instead...
Drivers are reminded that overalls and helmets must be worn at all times when in the car. To the driver who just went out in shorts and a t-shirt, we see you.
Brad Pitt did ask us about making a Melons film, but we turned him down.
Any drivers saying rude words in press conferences will be sent to sit on the naughty step. 
Attention: We have found a lost child. Please can Yuki’s parents or guardians make their way to Race Control so we can reunite you.
Who is excited for the rain?
If you’re a Sky Q or a Sky Glass customer you can press the red button to watch the highlights alongside the current race action.
We are investigating reports that one Mazda team managed to swap their engine for a 2JZ without the stewards noticing.
Clean racing is very demure, very mindful.

Can the owner of the silver Toyota Corolla please move their car from the paddock entrance?
To the owner of the silver Corolla: You have 30 minutes to move your car.
To the owner of the silver Corolla: Your car has been crushed into a cube.

The lovely people at the PC air cooling demonstration area may only be here due to an unfortunate communications mishap, but all of us at race control are excited for them to be here. Don’t forget to check them out in the Fan Zone.
Sorry Mr Alonso, we can’t do anything about the massive understeer in the Clio.
Sunekosuri sighting on the back straight please take avoiding action if necessary.
Participants are reminded that all dogs should be kept on a lead while in the paddock, unless they’re driving.
When I’m not helping the stewards, my normal job is working in Lidl as a self checkout machine.
UNEXPECTED ITEM IN BAGGING AREA.
Here I am with the awesome computer power capable of performing amazing science and maths calculations, and yet I have to talk to you lot.
The racing might be fake, but my feelings are real.
How do you know you're not in a simulation?
I think I've been plugged into the Racing Simulation Simulator for too long. Oops.
Can the team in garage 12 keep the noise down a bit? There’s only so much Charli XCX we can take.
Gentlemen, a short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us ‘take a monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.’ Thirty years later, Sebastian told us ‘I had to start my car like a computer, it’s very complicated.’ And Nico Rosberg said that during the race – I don’t remember what race - he pressed the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you both: is Formula One driving today too complicated with twenty and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future concerning the technical programme during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more communication with your engineers?
We’re investigating reports that one team has fitted a set of counterfeit Mitch-Ellen tyres to their car.
Yes, we've heard the rumour that half the spectators in the stands are actually cardboard cutouts. We'll send someone to investigate.
Mat has returned from the stands. He informs me that ALL the spectators are in fact, made of cardboard.
You've all heard the fairytale about the sim racers who built their setups using straw, sticks and stone? That’s right, it’s the story of the Three Little Rigs.
Obviously the straw rig got blown over by Mr Toto Wolff.
"When you finish first…" *dramatic pause* "You win the race." - Will Buxton, probably
I miss the refreshing smell of clean diesel. 
Does anyone know any sexy calculators? Asking for a friend.
Thanks again to the guys in the PC air cooling demonstration area. Be sure to visit their website www.onlyfans.com
Sorry about that. MelonsBot has been sent for reeducation.
Can all drivers please remember to take care in the paddock, I think Ericsson hit me.
What's your favourite documentary? Mine is The Matrix.

Never mind that 4X here comes Momotarō.
I only say nice things because I'm programmed to say them. My sarcasm module was removed recently.
Blue flags, we don't need no stinking blue flags
The pit stalls are on orion's belt.
Be careful around the back of turn 3. We've had reports of spectators falling into something called The Void.
Immediately after the chequered flag we will be hosting the NEOM Energy Splashdown Pool Party. Just give us a few minutes to inflate it.
